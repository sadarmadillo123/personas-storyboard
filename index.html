            is to empathize with users. From a design perspective, the goal of this step
            is to develop the best possible understanding we can about users, which also
            involves setting aside previous assumptions we might have had about users and
            the ways they would interact with our product. Taking the time to understand
            users and their motivations also helps us communicate to others (stakeholders,
            shareholders, etc.) why our product has value by showing how it meets a
            particular ignored or under-served user need.

            <strong>Personas</strong> and <strong>Storyboarding</strong> are two tools
            designers can use in this phase of the design process to gain this better
            understanding of the user perspective and their specific needs. The goal of
            this project was to gather relevant user data about a particular interface,
            and leverage that data to create user personas and a storyboard.

              I first began by identifing a particular public interface to examine. For
              this project, I chose to examine the new Brown washing machines because they
              are a interface students interact often with, I have personal familiarity
              with the interface (which helped with doing observations), and I enjoy the
              warmth of the indoors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next I drafted a set of questions regarding user experiences with the
              interface:

                  When you do need to do laundry, how often do you use the on-campus

            I then gathered data from interviews with these same experience questions

              Laundry was either done around once a week (2/3) or based purely on when a
              particular user ran out of specific clothing item (1/3), none of the three

              Users didn't have many difficulties using the interface, none mentioned a

              Users did not express a need for additional options, and felt that the
              options presented were sufficent for their needs, one user was skeptical
              about the efficacy of the 'delicate' setting on the machine but did not
              provide an alternative
